                            <p>
                                The PARTHENOS Virtual Language Observatory Version-1.0 (PAVLOV-1.0) faceted browser was developed within <a href="https://wwww.clarin.eu">CLARIN</a> 
                                as a means to explore linguistic resources, services and tools available within CLARIN and related communities.
                                Its aim is to provide an easy to use interface, allowing for a uniform search and discovery process for a large number of 
                                resources from a wide variety of domains and providers.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="help-section">
                            <h2>Faceted browsing</h2>
                            <p>
                                The PAVLOV-1.0 search interface presents a number of <strong>facets</strong>,  for each of which one or more values can be selected in order to <strong>narrow down</strong>
                                the selection of displayed records. For example, to only include records that relate to the French language, open the facet <em>Language</em>
                                and select the value <em>French</em>. Notice that next to each available value, a number is displayed that indicates the number of records within
                                the current selection that contain that value, in other words the number of remaining records should that value be selected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Only the values that occur in the current selection (that is, the records that match the already selected values and the optional
                                textual query (see <a href="#syntax">below</a>)) are shown. PAVLOV-1.0 shows up to ten of the <strong>most frequently occurring values</strong> for each facet 
                                when you click on the name of any facet. If there are more then ten available values, there is a link labeled <em>more...</em>, which leads 
                                to a pop-up showing all available values (given the current selections), than can be filtered textually and sorted either alphabetically or 
                                by number of matching records. It is also possible to search for facet values by typing (part of) a value in the filter box below the facet name 
                                and above the facet values (<em>'Type to search for more'</em>) in the panel next to the search results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <wicket:link><img src="res/images/facet-selection.png" class="img-responsive pull-right" alt="Facet selection" /></wicket:link>
                                <strong>Multiple values</strong> can be selected within the same facet, thus <strong>broadening</strong> the selection. For example,
                                to broaden the results to also include Occitan after having selected <em>French</em>, type that word or its first few letters in the filter box
                                of the language facet. As soon as the option <em>Occitan; Provençal</em> appears, you can select it and consequently the search results will be
                                updated. Notice that in this example <em>Occitan; Provençal</em> appears as an option only because there are records within the existing selection 
                                that relate to this value. Values that do not occur in the present selection are excluded from the list of available facet values.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is also possible to <strong>narrow down</strong> on values within a facet, for example to search for multi-lingual corpora that
                                cover a number of specific languages. To do this, go to the <strong><em>Search options</em></strong> box (below the facets) and set the
                                <em>Multiple value selection behaviour</em> to <em>AND</em>. Do this <em>before making your selection</em> as it will not affect
                                existing (partial) selections. In the <em>Search options</em> box you will also find a number of other advanced controls to tweak
                                your query.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Facets that do not have any matching records given the current selection will not be displayed in the facets panel in the PAVLOV-1.0 search interface.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="help-section">
                            <h2 id="syntax">Search syntax</h2>
                            
                            <p>
                                In addition to navigating the resources by means of the selection of facet values, the PAVLOV-1.0 faceted browser also allows for searching
                                by means of <strong>textual queries</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Such queries are to be entered in the large <strong>text box</strong> at the top of the main page or faceted browsing page with the 
                                button labeled 'Search' next to it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In its simplest form, a search query consists of one or more terms, separated by whitespace. Such queries result
                                in the retrieval of all documents that have one or more occurrences of <em>all</em> of the included search terms. In other words,
                                an <strong>AND</strong> operator is implied by default.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Advanced querying</h3>

                            <p>
                                It is possible to construct a more specific query by utilising the advanced <strong>syntax features</strong> that the PAVLOV-1.0 supports.
                                The supported syntax is that of the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html">Lucene Query Parser</a>
                                <sup><a href="#noteedismax" id="refedismax">1</a></sup>.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The Lucene Query Parser syntax allows for the following <strong>boolean operators</strong>: 'AND', 'OR', 'NOT', '+'
                                and '-'. It also allows for <strong>grouping</strong> of terms by means of parenthesis. 
                                Terms can be combined into <strong>phrases</strong> by means of double quote characters.
                                <strong>Ranges</strong> can be specified using square brackets and the word 'TO' (see below for examples).
                            </p>
                            
                            <wicket:link><img src="res/images/advanced-search-syntax.png" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Using the advanced search syntax" /></wicket:link>
                            
                            The following <strong>examples</strong> illustrate the usage of these operators.
                            Click any of the following examples to perform that query  on the actual data currently in PAVLOV-1.0:
                            <ul>
                                <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=German%20AND%20acquisition">German AND acquisition</a> (all records that match both terms)
                                    <ul>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><a class="example-query" href="search/?q=Portuguese+NOT+Brazil">Portuguese NOT Brazil</a> is an equivalent query</li>

                            <p>
                                In addition to the logical operators, the syntax also allows for search for occurrences of a term within a <strong>specific field</strong>,
                                such as language or modality. To do so, enter the name of the field and the term to search for, separated by a semicolon.
                                The asterisk ('*') can be used to achieve partial matches. Quotes are required to match a term that contains spaces.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The following <strong>field names</strong> are available: 
                                language, country, continent, modality, genre, subject, format, organisation, resourcetype, keyword, resources.

                                After you have submitted a query, selected one or more facet values, or a combination of these, the search results get updated.
                                By default, for each item in the search result, the <strong>record</strong>'s title and a snippet of its description are shown
                                (if available). In addition, a number of <strong>icons</strong> are shown that indicate the number and type of resource(s) available within the record,
                                and which availability level (public, academic or restricted), licence and/or usage conditions apply. Hover over the icons to discover the meaning of

                                You can <strong>expand</strong> a search result item (by pressing the <i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> icon) to see more 
                                details. In addition to the full description in case it was truncated in the original view, a number of additional record properties
                                such as collection, language and organisation are shown (if available) as well as a list of up to ten resources linked to by the record.
                                You can click through to the record page or immediately access any of the listed resources. Be sure to take notice of the

                                availability. The availability of a title, description or one or more linked resources within a record also contributes to the

                                Clicking the title of a search result (or <em>record</em>) brings you to a new page that can we will refer to as the <strong>record page</strong>.
                                The page is organised into a number of <em>tabs</em>, showing different types of information relating to the record. If you are interested in
                                obtaining or processing the resources provided by a record in any way, first have a look at the information under the <strong><em>Availability</em> tab</strong>.
                                This information will tell you what conditions apply to the usage of the resource(s). Some records may not provide clear and complete information. When in doubt,
                                it is strongly recommended to contact and ask the provider of the resource(s). Use the contact information provided in the <em>All metadata</em> section
                                of the record page, or navigate to the provider's pages via the <em>Show the original provider's page for this record</em> link if present. If you
                                need to know more and no contact information whatsoever is available in relation to a record, please <a href="mailto:vlo@clarin.eu">contact CLARIN</a>.

                                A list of the actual resource(s) can be found by selecting the <strong><em>Resources</em> tab</strong>. This list is presented as a table, which shows the 
                                <strong>file names</strong> of all resources along with their <strong>type</strong>. Additional <strong>details</strong> for an individual resource can 
                                be found by expanding a row (by clicking <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>). Click a <strong>file name</strong> of a resource to access it
                                directly. You may be presented with a request to authenticate depending on the accessibility of the file. Be aware that not all files within a record may have 
                                the same level of accessibility, and different licences may apply.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some records have no resources listed under the <em>Resources</em> tab, for example because the record does not represent individually accessible files
                                but rather an online tool, service or website. In these cases generally there should be one or more of the following <strong>links</strong> below the title of 
                                the record (above the tabs):
                                <ul>
                                    <li><em>Show the original provider's page for this record</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Search page for this record</em></li>
                                    <li><em>Plain text search via Federated Content Search</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                Using these, you will be able to access or use the described resource.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                In some cases, you will find resources nor links to related pages. This is often the case for <strong>collection records</strong> that do not point to
                                resources themselves, but instead are part of a <em>hierarchy</em>. If this is the case, a <strong><em>Hierarchy</em> tab</strong> is available, which 
                                contains a tree that allows you to browse through this hierarchy and discover underlying records that may contain links to concrete resources or pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you encounter a record that contains no listed resources, no links to pages and is not part of a hierarchy either you can have a look at the content
                                under the <strong><em>All metadata</em> tab</strong> to see if the metadata contains any pointers to resources. If this is not the case either, you may
                                want to report the page (using the <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true" title="Report an issue"></i> button) or send a report by e-mail
                                to <a href="mailto:vlo@clarin.eu">vlo@clarin.eu</a>.

                                Many of the resources that can be discovered through PAVLOV-1.0 are fit for processing using one or more of many specialised
                                tools. The <em>Language Resource Inventory</em> provides an 
                                <a href="https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/discover?filtertype=type&filter_relational_operator=equals&filter=toolService">overview </a>
                                of tools an services available in or collected by CLARIN. You can obtain (handles to) the resources that you are interested in from the record's page in the 
                                PAVLOV-1.0 or from the original provider (see <a href="#accessing-resources">Accessing resources</a>) and then manually use them as input for the tool or service
                                provided that you are granted access to both the resources and the tool or service, and that the former supports the exact type of resource at hand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                CLARIN has streamlined this process for a number of tools and a specific set of resource types, allowing you to easily discover tools that can be applied
                                to a specific resource, and in case of a match immediately proceed to apply one or more tools to the selected resource. The following section describes
                                how to use this feature right from a record's page in PAVLOV-1.0.

                                The <em>Resources</em> of a record page (the page to which the title of a search results links) shows a table of individual resources collectively described
                                by a record's metadata. All resources in this table have an 'options' menu (triggered by clicking the "<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-option-horizontal"></span>" area).
                                From this menu, select the option <em>Process with Language Resource Switchboard</em>. This will take you to the <strong>Language Resource Switchboard (LRS)</strong>. Here you can
                                either adjust the file type and content language values or go with the values detected by the LRS. Then click <em>Show Tools</em>, and if any tools supporting the
                                chosen file type and language are known to the LRS, they will appear on the page in a categorised list. For each tool a description and some general information 
                                is shown (including whether usage of the tool involves authentication or authorisation), along with a button that opens the tool with the selected resource. From
                                there, follow the instructions provided by the tool or service.
                            </p>

                                Not all tools available within CLARIN have been connected to the LRS, but additional tools get added frequently. If you think a tool is missing that could be added,
                                please contact the tool's maintainers and/or the LRS contact person (see the <a href="http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/clrs">About page of the LRS</a>).

                                You may have tools or data relevant to CLARIN's community: digitally accessible language-related resources, or tools/services that either process or 
                                produce such resources. We have a standardised procedure to 'harvest' (retrieve and aggregate) metadata describing resources, for which we use the 
                                <a href="https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI-PMH</a> protocol. If you are already offering metadata in the <a href="http://dublincore.org">Dublin Core</a>, 
                                <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.html">OLAC</a> or <a href="https://www.clarin.eu/cmdi">CMDI</a> format, please send the details
                                to <a href="mailto:vlo@clarin.eu">vlo@clarin.eu</a>. CLARIN centres that provide metadata over OAI-PMH are harvested automatically.
                                If you have relevant resources but either do not have metadata yet or are not making metadata available over OAI-PMH, CLARIN may be able to help you as well.
